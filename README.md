# Historical Encryption

My education field is pure mathematics and i studied about **Historical mathematics**. In past people used mathematics for **encryption** the letter text or message.

But it was not much complex such as nowdays.

They used two different way:

- Change order (Move each char)
- Change and switching the letters
